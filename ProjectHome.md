A little script which is able to calculate if mining crypto-currencies can be profitable for you (according your hash rate and your power cost).

This is just a little python script that is able to calculate
  * breakeven (how much time is required to pay hardware)
  * revenue (how many BTC (or USD) you will get per day, per month... after substacting power cost)

You can calculate BTC or LTC mining profit (and probably other crypto currencies if you are ready to get your hands dirty ;-)

This calculator was inspired by websites such as :
  * http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/ for BTC mining profitability calculator
  * https://www.litecoinpool.org/calc/ for LTC mining profitability calculator
